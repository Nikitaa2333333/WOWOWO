    "description": "\t\n\t\n\t\nShare to:\n      \n65L/ 90L/ 110L High-pressure Steam Autoclave\n\nFeatures and functions:\n\n1. Large-diameter sterilization chamber：The 40 cm large-diameter sterilization chamber provides an exceptionally spacious environment to meet a wide range of sterilization needs.\n\n2. Sterilization temperature：105-138℃.\n\n3. Exhaust control ：After sterilization is complete, the exhaust valve can automatically open to release the exhaust at a pre-set temperature.\n\n4. Verification interface: Provides temperature and pressure inspection ports for easy calibration.\n\n5. Saturated steam monitoring：The system automatically monitors the expulsion of cold air to ensure a pure steam sterilization environment, guaranteeing optimal sterilization effectiveness.\n\n6. Pressure performance：The chamber is designed to withstand a pressure of up to 0.35 MPa, and each unit is tested with a water pressure of up to 0.44 MPa. Advanced pressure protection ensures the safety load of the equipment.\n\n7. Intelligent control system:The microcomputer chip-based intelligent control system monitors the temperature and pressure inside the sterilization chamber in real-time. The chamber lid can only be opened under safe temperature and pressure conditions. The system also provides fully automatic control of the sterilization process and allows for convenient maintenance, inspection, calibration, recording, and future upgrades.\n\n8. Six preset programs:Includes six fixed programs for liquid sterilization and holding, solid sterilization and drying, agar melting and holding, and waste sterilization.\n\n9. Memory storage system:Users can set their own parameters, create multiple programs, and access them at any time. The system allows for operation permissions to be set at three levels—user, administrator, and engineer—to facilitate effective use and management of the sterilizer.\n\n10. Door-opening temperature: Each program can be set with a specific cooling lock door-opening temperature based on the thermal inertia of the sterilized items. This prevents users from opening the door when the items (especially liquid sterilized items) are still in an unsafe condition, thus avoiding burns.\n\n11. Drying  function: Thorough  drying  that  meets  CE  standards,  with  a  cooling lock  mechanism.\n\n12. One-touch inquiry function: Allows checking of current time, total number of sterilization cycles, fault occurrence time, and codes.\n\n13. Scheduled start function: Allows you to set a start time so that the sterilizer automatically starts at the scheduled time.\n\nModel:\n\nHB65/ HB90/ HB110\n\nBrand:\n\nYingtai\n\nQuantity:\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\nInquire\nAdd to Basket\n\n\n\t\n\nProduct Description\n\n65L/ 90L/ 110L High-pressure Steam Autoclave\n\n\n\n\nSafety Features\n\n1. User-Friendly Design: The chamber lid and tabletop are covered with heat-insulating resin materials, providing both protection against burns and an aesthetically pleasing appearance. The upward-opening flip-top door saves space, while the rounded corners prevent injury. The specially designed steam discharge and collection system minimizes steam burn risks and enhances operational convenience.\n\n\n\n\n2. Interlock Mechanism and Safety Protection: The safety interlock system is designed to be more sensitive and secure. The chamber lid cannot be opened if there is pressure or steam inside the chamber. The lid can only be opened when the pressure gauge reads \"0\" MPa. The sterilizer will not start heating if the chamber lid is not properly locked. These features enhance the overall safety of the machine.\n\n\n\n\n3. Over-temperature and Heating Protection: The system continuously monitors the temperature inside the sterilization chamber. If the temperature becomes too high or heating is abnormal, power will be automatically cut off to prevent overheating.\n\n\n\n\n4. Automatic Fault Detection System: The machine performs an automatic self-check when powered on. If a fault occurs during operation, an audible alarm will sound, and a fault code will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n5. Lid Closure Check System: The system automatically detects whether the chamber lid is securely locked. If the lid is not properly locked, the sterilizer will not start.\n\n\n\n\n6. Leakage, Over-current, and Short-Circuit Protection: If there is leakage in the heating elements or other components, or if over-current or short-circuit conditions occur, the system will automatically cut off power to prevent user injury.\n\n\n\n\n7. Water Shortage and Independent Dry-Burning Protection: Equipped with a low water level sensor and independent dry-burning protection device, the system can monitor the water level in the chamber in real-time to prevent dry burning and avoid false readings. If the low water level sensor fails, the overheat and dry-burning protection system will automatically activate, cut off power to the heating ring, and sound an alarm to ensure safety.\n\n\n\n\n8. Dual Pressure Protection: The system includes both a mechanical safety valve and an electronic over-pressure protection system. If pressure becomes abnormal, the system will relieve pressure and cut off power while sounding an alarm.\n\n\n\n\n9. Back end Safety Testing: The system can be periodically tested for safety and protective measures.\n\n\n\n\n10. Over-pressure Testing: Regular testing ensures that the instrument’s over-pressure protection system can automatically cut off power or that the safety valve can open to relieve pressure.\n\n\n\n\n11. Performance Testing: The instrument's safety performance has been tested by national authorized inspection agencies, and a test report is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nHB65A Standard Type\n\nHB65B  Auto Water Replenishment Type\n\nHB65C Auto Drying Type\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nHB90AStandard Type\n\nHB90BAuto Water Replenishment Type\n\nHB90CAuto Drying Type\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nHB110AStandard Type\n\nHB110BAuto Water Replenishment Type\n\nHB110CAuto Drying Type\n\n\n\n\nCapacity\n\n\t\n\n65L\n\n\t\n\n90L\n\n\t\n\n110L\n\n\n\n\nDimensions (L × W × H) mm\n\n\t\n\n664×660×994.5\n\n\t\n\n664×660×994.5\n\n\t\n\n664×660×1200\n\n\n\n\nSterilization Chamber Dimensions (Diameter × Height) mm\n\n\t\n\nφ400×530\n\n\t\n\nφ400×730\n\n\t\n\nφ400×920\n\n\n\n\nRated Power\n\n\t\n\n2800W\n\n\t\n\n3400W\n\n\t\n\n4500W\n\n\n\n\nRated Voltage\n\n\t\n\n220V±10%50Hz\n\n\n\n\nTemperature Display Accuracy\n\n\t\n\n0.1℃\n\n\n\n\nOperating Environment\n\n\t\n\n5℃~40℃、Relative Humidity10%～85%\n\n\n\n\nSterilization Chamber Material\n\n\t\n\nSUS304Stainless Steel\n\n\n\n\nSterilization Working Temperature\n\n\t\n\n105℃~143℃\n\n\n\n\nSterilization Time Pre-set Range\n\n\t\n\n1minute ～9999minutes\n\n\n\n\nMelting Temperature Pre-set Range\n\n\t\n\n60℃~100℃\n\n\n\n\nMelting Time Pre-set Range\n\n\t\n\n1minute～9999minutes\n\n\n\n\nInsulation Temperature Pre-set Range\n\n\t\n\n45℃~60℃\n\n\n\n\nInsulation Time Pre-set Range\n\n\t\n\n1minute～9999minutes\n\n\n\n\nDoor Opening Temperature Pre-set Range\n\n\t\n\nSolid, Agar, and Waste Modes: 40°C ~ 99°C        Liquid Mode: 40°C ~ 80°C\n\n\n\n\nClock Function\n\nTimer Pre-set Range\n\n\t\n\nTimer Pre-set Range: Set operating time (year, month, day, hour, minute), check current time (year, month, day, hour, minute), total sterilization cycles, fault occurrence time, and code.\n\n\n\n\nPressure Gauge Display Range\n\n\t\n\n0～0.6Mpa\n\n\n\n\nPressure\n\n\t\n\nChamber Design Pressure: 0.35 MPa; Each product comes with a quality certificate and a certificate issued by the special equipment manufacturing supervision and inspection department.\n\n\n\n\nPressure Safety Protection\n\n\t\n\nDual independent pipeline measurement and control, mechanical and electronic dual pressure protection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSterilization Modes\n\n\t\n\n·  Solid Mode: Heating → Sterilization → Exhaust, Air Cooling\n\n·  Solid with Drying Mode: Heating → Sterilization → Drainage, Exhaust → Drying\n\n·  Liquid Mode: Heating → Sterilization → Pre-cooling → Exhaust\n\n·  Liquid with Insulation Mode: Heating → Sterilization → Pre-cooling → Exhaust → Insulation\n\n·  Waste Mode: Heating → Sterilization → Exhaust, Air Cooling\n\n·  Agar Mode: Heating → Melting → Insulation\n\n\n\n\nExhaust Control and Water Tank\n\n\t\n\nFully automatic internal exhaust (see instructions for exhaust temperature settings), built-in large-capacity steam condensate collection bottle and water tank\n\n\n\n\nCover Opening Method and Interlocking Device\n\n\t\n\nUnique eight-column interlocking device, flip-cover switch, touch-type handle\n\n\n\n\nController and Memory Storage Function\n\n\t\n\nMicrocomputer intelligent control system. 6 fixed operation modes, 82 modifiable modes, 88 memory storage programs\n\n\n\n\nSafety Devices\n\n\t\n\nDoor lock interlocking device; Cover closing check; Dry burn protection; Water level sensor monitoring; Electronic over pressure protection; Mechanical safety valve; Over temperature and heating protection; Over current and short circuit protection; Leakage protection; Cooling lock; Burn injury safety protection; Automatic fault detection system\n\n\n\n\nAccessories\n\n\t\n\nCondensate collection bottle, water separation plate, drainage hose, stainless steel basket\n\n\n\n\nOptional Accessories\n\n\t\n\nPrinter, cooling fan, item temperature sensor, USB output\n\n\n\n\nStainless Steel Baskets\n\n\t\n\n(φ360×230)1pcs(φ360×200)1pcs\n\n\t\n\n(φ360×200)1pcs(φ360×400)1pcs\n\n\t\n\n(φ360×200)2pcs(φ360×400)1pcs\n\nNote: The upper limits for cooling lock door temperature and exhaust temperature are related to the boiling point.\n\n\n\n\nOther Optional Accessories\n\n\n\n\n1.
